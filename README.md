1. Executive Summary
This penetration test was conducted on a vulnerable lab system (Metasploitable2, ip address 192.168.237.4) to simulate real-world attack scenarios in a safe environment. The goal was to identify exploitable vulnerabilities, assess their risk levels, and provide actionable remediation guidance.
Objective:
To perform a penetration test on the Metasploitable2 environment in order to identify security vulnerabilities.
Overall Risk Posture:
The target environment was found to be highly vulnerable, with multiple critical-severity weaknesses that could allow an attacker to take full control. 
 Key Findings:
3 High-risk vulnerabilities (Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, FTP Backdoor)
2 Medium-risk vulnerabilities (XSS, Weak SSH credentials)
1 Low-risk issue (Information Disclosure)
Business Impact: If exploited in a production environment, these vulnerabilities could lead to full system compromise, data leakage, and unauthorized access.

2. Methodology
The test followed a structured approach based on industry standards (OWASP, PTES):
Assessment Type: This was a simulated penetration test on an isolated lab environment.
      Phases:
üîç Reconnaissance
This is about gathering as much information as possible about the target without actively trying to exploit it.
Passive Reconnaissance
The tools to be used (whois, nslookup, dig, Shodan, theHarvester) for the passive reconnaissance phase are powerful tools for gathering information on public-facing websites and organizations. However, since my target, Metasploitable 2, is a virtual machine on an isolated private network. It doesn't have a public domain name, and its IP address isn't listed on the internet.
Why these tools listed above won't work for this project:
whois, nslookup, dig: These tools query public DNS and registration databases. Since my target is a private IP, there is no public record for them to find.
Shodan: This is a search engine for internet-connected devices. It crawls public IP addresses. My private, non-internet-connected Metasploitable 2 machine is not on Shodan's radar.
theHarvester: This tool gathers information like email addresses, subdomains, and hostnames from public sources. Again, since my target is not a public organization, there is nothing for it to find.
Conclusion: For this specific lab project, passive reconnaissance is not a practical step, because my target (Metasploitable2) is a virtual machine.This is why passive reconnaissance was skipped for this particular lab project.
Active Reconnaissance:
Use Nmap to scan the target:
nmap -sV -p- 192.168.56.101
-sV: Detect service versions
-p-: Scan all 65535 ports
Look for vulnerable services like:
FTP (port 21)
Telnet (port 23)
Samba (port 139/445)
MySQL (port 3306)
VNC (port 5900)
 nmap -sV -p- <192.168.237.4>

üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Assessment
Nmap scripts (--script vuln)

üí• Exploitation
Metasploit modules (vsftpd_234_backdoor, samba/usermap_script)

üß† Post-Exploitation

 Lateral Movement (if multi-host lab)
Scan the internal network:
ip a
nmap -sP 192.168.237.4/24
Use credentials or exploits to pivot to other machines.
Example: Use SSH with stolen credentials:
ssh user@192.168.236.4
There is only one host, therefore there is no lateral movement.

üßπ Step 7: Clean Up (Optional)
If you want to be stealthy:
history -c
rm -rf /tmp/*
